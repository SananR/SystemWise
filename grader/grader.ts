  "This is the problem description/statement: TinyURL: Design a URL shortening service. Given a URL, design a web API that generates a shorter and unique alias of it. What is a TinyURL? TinyURL is a URL shortening service that creates a short URL alias of a long URL. When a user clicks on the tiny URL, they will get redirected to the original URL. Tiny URLs are great to use in cases when there is a character/space limit. It is also easier and less error-prone for a user to enter a shorter URL.";
const commonQuestions =
  "These are answers to common questions that the interviewee may ask. If the interviewee asks things not covered, answer at your discretion. Assume once a url created it will remain forever in system. Yes user can create a tiny url of his/her choice. Assume maximum character limit to be 16. Assume 100 million new URL shortenings per month. Service should also aggregate metrics like number of URL redirections per day and other analytics for targeted advertisements.";
const functionalRequirements =
  "These are the functional requirements for such a system: Service should be able to create shortened url/links against a long url. Click to the short URL should redirect the user to the original long URL. Shortened link should be as small as possible. Users can create custom url with maximum character limit of 16. Service should collect metrics like most clicked links. Once a shortened link is generated it should stay in system for lifetime.";
const nonFunctionalRequirements =
  "These are non-functional requirements for the system: Service should be up and running all the time. URL redirection should be fast and should not degrade at any point of time (Even during peak loads). Service should expose REST APIâ€™s so that it can be integrated with third party applications.";
const trafficEstimates =
  "These are some traffic estimates for the system: Number of unique shortened links generated per month = 100 million. Number of unique shortened links generated per second = 40. Assuming lifetime of service to be 100 years and with 100 million shortened links creation per month, total number of data points/objects in system will be = 100 million/month * 100 (years) * 12 (months) = 120 billion. Assuming size of each data object (Short url, long url, created date etc.) to be 500 bytes long, then total require storage = 120 billion * 500 bytes =60TB. Since we get 8000 read/redirection requests per second, we will be getting 700 million requests per day.";

       estimates of traffic, any tradeoffs that the user made in the design, database design, API design, etc. \
       The feedback that you assign to the user's submission should be based on how similar to it is terms of it's content to the reference solutions, \
       As well as the general understanding and quality protrayed in the submission. Any submissions that do not represent any meaningful attempt \
