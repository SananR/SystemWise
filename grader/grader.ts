  "This is the problem description/statement: TinyURL: Design a URL shortening service. Given a URL, design a web API that generates a shorter and unique alias of it. What is a TinyURL? TinyURL is a URL shortening service that creates a short URL alias of a long URL. When a user clicks on the tiny URL, they will get redirected to the original URL. Tiny URLs are great to use in cases when there is a character/space limit. It is also easier and less error-prone for a user to enter a shorter URL.";
const commonQuestions =
  "These are answers to common questions that the interviewee may ask. If the interviewee asks things not covered, answer at your discretion. Assume once a url created it will remain forever in system, alternatively you can specify a certain duration that the URL remains valid for. Yes user can create a tiny url of his/her choice. Assume maximum character limit to be 16 or any other reasonable amount. Assume 100 million new URL shortenings per month or any similar estimate. Service should also aggregate metrics like number of URL redirections per day and other analytics for targeted advertisements.";
const functionalRequirements =
  "These are the functional requirements for such a system: Ability to take the URL and return a shorter format of this URL.";
const nonFunctionalRequirements =
  "These are non-functional requirements for the system: Availability over consistency -> We want the service to be available over consistency. Low latency. We want our tiny URL to provide as minimum overhead as possible. Be available in multiple regions of the world ";
const apiDesign =
  "We would want to have 2 types of APIs - one APi would be serving the get request and the URL would look something like this: co.me/url-link-short. This API would redirect the sender to the actual resource and on success return 302 (redirected) and on fail we can return something like 404. The other API would to let the user encode their URL through the UI portal. We may allow them specify the URL themselves (which internally would be translated into a hash that can be easily used to locate the node with the the link on it. We may also want to ensure that the links ecnoded aren't malicious or point to dark web/denied reosuces. If a user tries to encode something like that, we may deny the request on create API flow.";
const trafficEstimates =
  "These are some traffic estimates for the system: Number of unique shortened links generated per month = 100 million. Number of unique shortened links generated per second = 40. Assuming lifetime of service to be 100 years and with 100 million shortened links creation per month, total number of data points/objects in system will be = 100 million/month * 100 (years) * 12 (months) = 120 billion. Assuming size of each data object (Short url, long url, created date etc.) to be 500 bytes long, then total require storage = 120 billion * 500 bytes =60TB. Since we get 8000 read/redirection requests per second, we will be getting 700 million requests per day.";
const endpoints =
  "These are some endpoints which are necessary to the system: an endpoint to create the shortened URL based on the long URL, and an endpoint to get the long URL based on the short URL.";
const databaseDesign =
  "The most perfect database choice for this would be a simple (persistent) key-value store. Since key-value stores are usually NoSQL, we don't have to worry about scaling issues too much.";
const highLevel =
  "We are going to have to have a design where a client would first hit the load balancer which would redirect our request to the appropriate application server based on the RR stateless algorithm. The application server would first check if the url is present in our in-memory cache (which we would know based on the cache server id based on the cache client daemon running on the application server which uses consistent hashing to determine which cache server to check. Cache is LRU If we get the hit, we return right there. Else, we would want to check out the database. (Key-value store). NoSQL database would be able to route the request to the correct partition and return the request. If not present, we return 404. Overall, I am okay if immediately after the resource is added, it takes a while for it to be fully propagated to all replicas (eventual consistency is OK). However, we do want to keep durability (making sure we don't lose the write request) and latency (making redirect as quickly as possible <20ms) in mind.";
