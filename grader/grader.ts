Moreover, when user click on the tiny url, he gets redirected to original url. Tiny url are exceedingly handy to share through sms/tweets (where there is limit to number of characters that can be messaged/tweeted) and also when they are printed in books/magazines etc.(Less character implies less printing cost). In addition, it is easy and less error prone to type a short url when compared to its longer version.";

Assume once a url created it will remain forever in system. Yes user can create a tiny url of his/her choice. Assume maximum character limit to be 16. Assume 100 million new URL shortenings per month. Service should also aggregate metrics like number of URL redirections per day and other analytics for targeted advertisements.";

Service should collect metrics like most clicked links. Once a shortened link is generated it should stay in system for lifetime.";

Assuming lifetime of service to be 100 years and with 100 million shortened links creation per month, total number of data points/objects in system will be = 100 million/month * 100 (years) * 12 (months) = 120 billion. Assuming size of each data object (Short url, long url, created date etc.) to be 500 bytes long, then total require storage = 120 billion * 500 bytes =60TB. Since we get 8000 read/redirection requests per second, we will be getting 700 million requests per day.";

Each person access the url 5 times per day. that's 70 * 10^ 10 * 5 / 24/60/60 = 4 * 10^7 TPS It's a heavy read system while very low rate of write.

Detailed component design Dig deeper into 2-3 components and explain in detail how they work. For example, how well does each component scale? Any relevant algorithm or data structure you like to use for a component? Also you could draw a diagram using the diagramming tool to enhance your design... Trade offs/Tech choices We can use nosql db such as mongo db or dynamo because the db schema is simple Does not need strong consistency, response time matters Failure scenarios/bottlenecks Failure scenarios: There is a chance that the url accessed from cache is not the latest one. For example, there is an update for the shorten url but the cache and read database has not updated the latest one. Since this system does not need the strong consistency, we are ok with that. If there is a cache miss or url not correct, we can invalid cache and ask read database to copy from main database.";
