## Brief description of the web application

Codeify is a specialized web application designed to help aspiring and experienced infrastructure engineers alike sharpen their skills. Similar to LeetCode, Codeify offers a vast collection of problems focused on real-world infrastructure and systems challenges, including but not limited to popular systems such as TinyURL, and Spotify. Users can practice solving these problems, (compete with peers?), and track their progress over time. With detailed solutions and explanations, as well as instantaneous feedback powered by AI, Codeify aims to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical expertise in the infrastructure domain.
